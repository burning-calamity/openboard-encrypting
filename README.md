# Steganographia

**Steganographia: hoc est, ars per occultam scripturam animi voluntatem absentibus aperiendi certa** is a privacy-focused Android keyboard with integrated classical and modern cipher tools, direct cipher typing, emoji search, and multiple keyboard layouts.

## Building

Import the project into Android Studio or build it with the checked-in wrapper:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The project uses JDK 17, Gradle 8.5, and the Android Gradle Plugin declared in the root build file.

Before importing a source archive, verify that it does not contain a duplicated cipher block:

```sh
python3 tools/check-direct-cipher-source.py
```

If Android Studio reports that `getDirectCipherText`, `resetDirectCipherState`, or related methods are already defined, the local `LatinIME.java` contains two historical versions of the direct-cipher implementation. Replace that file with the tracked repository version, then run **Build > Clean Project**. In the canonical file, the cipher helper block ends before `onEvent`; do not merge another helper block after it.
